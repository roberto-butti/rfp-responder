Storyblok enables and drives the use of the atomic design approach.
Organizing design into components encourages reuse, especially when coupled with powerful tools provided by Storyblok such as:

- Preset: allows to prepare components with content ready for reuse (e.g., a banner for a specific product launch with the image ready, the copy ready, and the CTA link already prepared). In this case, it is possible to decide to reuse only the structure (the component) or the structure and content (the preset). Presets are useful at the component level, but also at content-type level. It means that you can create also "page" preset (article preset, product detail preset, landing page preset)
- Component inclusion by reference: it is possible to include in the page components stored in other places, reusing them by reference. This implies that the change to the original component is reflected on all pages that include it)
