With Storyblok you can create a relationship between stories. For example, you can create a relation between two articles, an article with an author, or a page with products etc.

If instead of having structured relationships, you simply want to create links between pages, you can use the link attribute in the editor field.
Through the link attribute, you can reference internal URLs.
