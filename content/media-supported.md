The platform has a specific section named "Assets" for managing assets like images, videos, audio, and documents.
It supports metadata for assets like alt/text, title/caption, tags, copyright information, and source information.
The assets can be managed as private (for private and not open/public assets) and an asset could have an expiration date.
