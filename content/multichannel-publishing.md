You have more than one way to achieve this, depending on the degree of content differentiation.
Whether the channels have strong differences in terms of content you can use one space for each channel.
Otherwise, you can organize content in one space by differentiating channel-specific content by folders (one folder for the mobile channel, one folder for web, and one folder with common elements).
APIs help in the retrieval of folder-specific content.
If, on the other hand, the content differs little, it is possible to use a stories-level or component-level "target" field to indicate which channel that specific content belongs to.
