For searching content, in the Storyblok UI for the content editors in the Content tab, you can filter for all the attributes of the Story (the pages, the articles, the product details).
Filtering allows the editors to filter with more than one field and if the Story (page, article, product detail, ...) has some relations with other Stories (article -> authors, page -> featured articles, page, featured products) you can search starting from the related stories (it means that you can find articles written by specific authors, or pages that includes some specific products etc)
In the Assets Management System, selecting a specific asset, you can list the Stories (page, articles, landing pages, products) that include the assets. It is useful to answer the question "which pages include the image abc.png"

From the API perspective, for searching content, there is the functionality "Filter queries".
With the "Filter queries" you're able to filter by specific attribute(s) of your stories. The filter_query parameter accepts an attribute and an operation key.
The operators are listed here: https://www.storyblok.com/docs/api/content-delivery/v2#filter-queries/overview

In addition to Storyblok's APIs if one wanted to implement a much more complex search using specific, search-focused tools such as Algolia, Storyblok also allows integration with these systems.
